# Rosenrot

This branch contains a minimalist version of rosenrot

- similar in many ways to the [original version of rose](https://github.com/mini-rose/rose-browser/tree/60173b6f5b562861b11dea17e3869ad6c3462bbb/src).
- compilable with tcc
- One c file, 390 lines (~356 excluding comments)
- Still some minimal niceties: zoom
