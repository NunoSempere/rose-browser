## Rosebud

Personal tweaks for [rose](https://github.com/mini-rose/rose), a minimal browser based on webkit2gtk

### Features

- tabs, cookies, caching
- minimal ui, autohiding elements
- ~400L code base (edit: no longer)
- custom gtk and websites css
- hackable without any knowledge
- builtin rose-mklink script for in-shell static links
- A few quality of life improvements.

### üëê Contribute

This is my personal version. Contribute upstream to [github.com/mini-rose/rose](https://github.com/mini-rose/) instead.

### To do
- [ ] Document stand_in.c better
- [ ] Look at using relative rather than absolute paths
- [ ] Figure out if downloading files is doable.
- [ ] Figure out better way to have plugins
- [ ] Double check newtab/next-tab behavior
- [ ] Find out what each of the css elements refers to.
- [ ] Use something other than Whatsapp as an example syslink.

Done:

- [x] Launch with more than one tab from command line
- [x] Figure out merge with upstream
- [x] String substitution on uri in order to redirect to better frontends.
- [x] Present "standard" browser keybindings as an alternative.
- [x] Fix zoom in new tab
- [x] Reader mode
- [x] Add reader mode to config.def.
- [x] Make tab bar slightly prettier.
- [x] Add "open in new window" functionality. 
  - Useful for opening links in new tab when clicking on them and selecting that option
  - And for actually opening links with the href new_tab option.

### Known bugs

- [ ] Doesn't work with when Spanish is selected as the language, for some reason.
