- tabs, cookies, caching
- minimal ui, autohiding elements
- ~400L code base (edit: no longer)
- custom gtk and websites css
- hackable without any knowledge
- builtin rose-mklink script for in-shell static links
- A few quality of life improvements.

### üëê Contribute 
This is my personal version. Contribute upstream to [github.com/mini-rose/rose](https://github.com/mini-rose/) instead.

### To do


- [ ] Add "open in new window" functionality. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40180757/webkit2gtk-get-new-window-link>
  - Useful for opening links in new tab when clicking on them and selecting that option
  - And for actually opening links with the href newtab option.
- [ ] Find out what each of the css elements refers to.

Done: 
- [x] String substitution on uri in order to redirect to better frontends.
- [x] Present "standard" browser keybindings as an alternative.
- [x] Fix zoom in new tab
- [x] Reader mode
- [x] Add reader mode to config.def.
- [x] Make tab bar slightly prettier.

### Known bugs

- [ ] Doesn't work with a Spanish keyboard layout, for some reason.
